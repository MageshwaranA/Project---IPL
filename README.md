Welcome to my IPL data analytics project! As a data entusiast, I'm always on the lookout for interesting datasets to analyze and derive insights from. When I came across the IPL dataset on Kaggle, I knew I had to dive in and explore the fascinating world of cricket!

To begin, I extracted the ball by ball information from the dataset and performed various transformations to prepare it for analysis. Once the data was cleaned and structured, I loaded it into various visualization tools to create an interactive dashboard using Shiny.

The dashboard has three sidebars, each displaying unique insights into the IPL data. One sidebar displays the batting stat table, providing a detailed analysis of the runs scored, strike rate, and other key metrics for each player. Another sidebar displays the bowling stat table, providing insights into the number of wickets taken, the economy rate, and other bowling statistics for each player.

In the final sidebar, an overall comparison of the players is provided, which helps us identify the top-performing players in the IPL. The dashboard utilizes spider charts and animated line charts to provide engaging and insightful visualizations that make it easy to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

As a data analyst, I'm always excited to discover new insights and trends from data. This project has been an excellent opportunity to showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. I hope you enjoy exploring the IPL data dashboard and gain valuable insights into the world of cricket!
